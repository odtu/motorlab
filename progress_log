**Problem and Progress Log**

After the workshop, I thought using a progress log might be useful instead of
writing loooooooong commit messages :)
We are also going to start learning about and using the TI controllers but
attacking a new challenge without completely defeating one didn't seem quite
nice to me.
The biggest problem we cannot overcome is multitasking the Arduino. I found some
useful stuff, maybe we should take a look at them:
