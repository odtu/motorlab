In the first file, I see that maybe it is possible to
generate a code without a delay. Creating classes, we
can both run the motor  and read the encoder value
first defining its pins in an other class:D I am excited
already:D

Very helpful document, I will try some coding now before
reading the other one.



## **Problem and Progress Log**

 After the workshop, I thought using a progress log might be useful instead of
 writing loooooooong commit messages :smile:

 We are also going to start learning about and using the TI controllers but
 attacking a new challenge without completely defeating one didn't seem quite
 nice to me.

 The biggest problem we cannot overcome is multitasking the Arduino. I found some
 useful stuff, maybe we should take a look at them:
